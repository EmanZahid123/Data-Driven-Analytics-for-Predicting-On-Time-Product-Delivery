    "The business scope for the Shipping Dataset involves developing a robust machine learning model to accurately predict whether the product that is shipped reached to customer on time or not. The application of this predictive model aims to optimize shipping system, improve on the basis of customer feedback, and contribute to wellbeing of our shipping company. This initiative aims for timely reach of each product to customer. The success of the project will be measured by the model's accuracy, precision, recall."
